# IDA C++ SDK
\section intro_sec Introduction
This is the official documentation of the IDA SDK 9.2.
Note that in order to remain consistent with platform-dependent definitions, \n
this documentation was generated as if we were compiling on a 32-bit Windows \n
system with Visual C++. The following preprocessor macros are assumed        \n
to be defined:
  __cplusplus         \n
  __X86__             \n
  __NT__              \n
  _MSC_VER            \n
  UNICODE             \n
  NO_OBSOLETE_FUNCS
